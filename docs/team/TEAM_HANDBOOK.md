## 4.0 AI Integration Strategy with THEA

*(Content to be drafted by @Athena with @Orion. This section should detail how THEA is central to our AI-assisted development strategy, its interaction with ContextVibes, and how teams should leverage it.)*

## 5.0 Knowledge Dissemination & Framework Evolution

To ensure our collective knowledge grows and our framework remains effective:

*   **Notification of New Resources:** When significant new learning resources (guides, playbooks, tooling examples) are added to the `ai-assisted-dev-framework` (including THEA artifacts) as a result of our Lessons Learned process, `Athena` or `Canon` will notify the team (e.g., via team meetings, dedicated communication channels).
*   **Regular Review of Framework Assets:** THEA and the `ai-assisted-dev-framework` itself, including its documented processes and guidance, are subject to periodic review and refinement. This is often driven by Sprint Retrospectives and specific PBIs prioritized by `Orion`.
*   **Accessibility:** All captured knowledge and framework documentation must be kept easily accessible and up-to-date within this repository, indexed via `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INDEX.md`.

## 6.0 Communication & Collaboration Norms

*(Content to be drafted by @Helms and @Canon. This section should cover team communication channels, meeting cadences, review processes for documentation and THEA artifacts, etc.)*
