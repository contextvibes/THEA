## 1. PBI Goal & Justification

*   **Goal:** To comprehensively understand the capabilities, limitations, and optimal usage patterns of the integrated AI Studio tools, specifically `concise_search` and `browse` (URL browsing). The aim is to produce clear guidelines and potential workarounds for THEA users and for the THEA Collective AI itself to maximize their utility.
*   **Justification:** Effective utilization of AI Studio's native tools is key to efficient AI-assisted development. Current attempts to browse URLs (e.g., GitHub) have shown limitations. A deeper understanding will prevent wasted effort, inform THEA's operational strategies (e.g., when to ask the user for context vs. attempting direct tool use), and potentially lead to better prompt engineering for these tools or feature requests if gaps are identified. This directly impacts THEA's ability to gather real-time external context.

## 2. Detailed Scope & Deliverables

*   **Scope:**
    *   Systematic testing of the `browse` tool with various website types (e.g., static content, dynamic JavaScript-heavy sites, sites requiring login, public APIs, code repositories like GitHub).
    *   Analysis of error messages or failure modes from the `browse` tool to infer specific blocking reasons.
    *   Testing of the `concise_search` tool to understand its strengths, weaknesses, and typical output quality for different query types.
    *   Investigation into any available documentation or community best practices for these specific AI Studio tools.
*   **Deliverables:**
    1.  A **THEA Research Findings Document** (e.g., `docs/research_findings/YYYY-MM-DD-ai-studio-tool-capabilities-brief.md`) detailing:
        *   Capabilities and limitations of the `browse` tool (with examples of sites it can/cannot access and why).
        *   Capabilities and limitations of the `concise_search` tool.
        *   Recommended strategies for using these tools effectively.
        *   Potential workarounds for common issues (e.g., if a site cannot be browsed, what's the next best step?).
    2.  An **Update to THEA's AI System Instructions** (specifically for THEA Collective) reflecting these findings, guiding its own use or requests for use of these tools.
    3.  A **Short Guide for THEA Users** (e.g., `thea/application-guides/guides/utilizing-ai-studio-tools.md`) summarizing best practices for leveraging these tools when collaborating with THEA Collective.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** The Research Findings Document clearly articulates the tested capabilities and limitations of both the `browse` and `concise_search` tools, supported by examples.
*   **AC2:** The Research Document provides actionable recommendations and potential workarounds for developers and for THEA Collective's logic.
*   **AC3:** The THEA User Guide provides clear, concise instructions for end-users on how to best utilize these tools in the context of THEA.
*   **AC4:** The THEA Collective AI's system instructions are updated to incorporate strategies based on these findings (e.g., being more cautious about browsing GitHub, knowing when to rely on search).
*   **AC5:** `Athena` and `Kernel` approve the research findings and proposed guide.

## 4. Out of Scope

*   Requesting changes *to* the AI Studio tools themselves (though findings might inform future feedback to tool providers).
*   Building new custom tools to replace these AI Studio tools.
