## 1. PBI Goal & Justification

This Product Backlog Item (PBI) aims to **formalize advanced project planning methodologies into a comprehensive THEA playbook.**

**Justification:** The THEA framework currently possesses several draft command files (`commands/plan.md`, `commands/plan-gh.md`, `commands/plan-tdd.md`) that outline robust processes for project blueprinting, iterative task breakdown, and the generation of LLM prompts. Consolidating these into a structured, official THEA playbook will:

* Provide a standardized, repeatable process for project initiation and planning.
* Ensure Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles are integrated early.
* Enhance the ability of THEA users (especially `Orion` and `Athena`) to effectively plan AI-assisted development projects.
* Create clear guidance on producing `plan.md` and `todo.md` artifacts.

## 2. Detailed Scope & Deliverables

* **Primary Deliverable:** A new Markdown playbook file located at `playbooks/planning/advanced_project_planning.md`.
* **Scope of Playbook Content:**
  * Detailed steps for drafting a project blueprint.
  * Methodology for decomposing the blueprint into small, iterative, implementable chunks.
  * Guidance on structuring each chunk for safe implementation.
  * Instructions and examples for creating a series of effective prompts for a code-generation LLM to implement each step.
  * Integration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices into the prompt generation and implementation cycle.
  * Clear definition of `plan.md` and `todo.md` artifacts, including their purpose and expected structure.
  * References to relevant THEA personas and their roles in this planning process.
* **Secondary Deliverable:** Update `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INDEX.md` to include a link and description for the new playbook.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** A new playbook file, `advanced_project_planning.md`, exists in the `playbooks/planning/` directory.
* **AC2:** The playbook's content comprehensively covers all items listed in the "Scope of Playbook Content" (Section 2).
* **AC3:** The playbook is written in clear, concise language, adhering to THEA's documentation standards (as overseen by `Canon` and `Scribe`).
* **AC4:** The playbook explicitly mentions the use and purpose of `plan.md` and `todo.md` files that result from the planning process.
* **AC5:** The `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INDEX.md` file is updated with an entry for the new `advanced_project_planning.md` playbook.
* **AC6:** The Product Owner (`Orion`) reviews and approves the content and structure of the new playbook.
* **AC7:** The corresponding GitHub Issue for this PBI (see `github_issue_url` in frontmatter) is closed upon completion and approval.

## 4. Out of Scope

* Development of any new schemas for `plan.md` or `todo.md` (this would be a separate PBI if needed).
* Creation of example `plan.md` or `todo.md` files beyond brief illustrative snippets within the playbook itself.
* Automation or `ContextVibes CLI` tooling related to this playbook (these would be separate PBIs).

## 5. Notes & Open Questions

* Should the original `commands/plan*.md` files be archived, deleted, or incorporated as an appendix into the new playbook? (Decision for `Orion`/`Athena`).
* Confirm if any specific diagramming or flowchart conventions should be used within the playbook.
