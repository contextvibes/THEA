# ContextVibes CLI Collaboration Strategy
# Version: 0.1.2 (Adds detail on providing input to Nexus)

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines our organization's collaborative relationship with the external development team for the `ContextVibes CLI`. Our primary goals in this collaboration are:

*   To serve as an active and effective **testing ground** for the `ContextVibes CLI`, providing valuable real-world usage feedback.
*   To contribute to the improvement and feature set of the `ContextVibes CLI` by sharing insights, requirements, and successful internal automation patterns.
*   To ensure our organization optimally leverages the `ContextVibes CLI` to enhance our AI-assisted development workflows.

## 2. Key Liaison: Nexus

The primary Point of Contact (PoC) and coordinator for all interactions related to the `ContextVibes CLI` and its external development team is **`Nexus`**. 

Refer to [Nexus's Persona Profile](./team_personas/NEXUS.MD) for full details on her role and responsibilities.

## 3. Feedback and Contribution Process (v0.1 - High Level)

1.  **Internal Feedback Collection:** All team members should channel `ContextVibes CLI` related feedback to `Nexus` (see Section 4.1 below).
2.  **Prioritization & Articulation:** `Nexus`, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, will prioritize feedback and articulate it clearly.
3.  **Communication with External Team:** `Nexus` will manage all formal communication with the `ContextVibes CLI` external team.
4.  **Tracking & Follow-up:** `Nexus` will track submitted items and provide updates.

## 4. Internal Feedback Loop for ContextVibes CLI

To facilitate effective feedback collection and ensure our internal experiences are captured:

### 4.1 Providing Input to Nexus (NEW SUB-SECTION)

To ensure `Nexus` can effectively manage and relay our collective input to the `ContextVibes CLI` team, team members should aim to provide the following:

*   **Channel:** (To be defined by `Nexus` post-team meeting - e.g., dedicated Slack channel, feedback form).
*   **For Bug Reports:**
    *   Clear description of the bug.
    *   Steps to reproduce.
    *   Observed behavior vs. expected behavior.
    *   `ContextVibes CLI` version.
    *   Relevant environment details (OS, `dev.nix` context if applicable - `Sparky` can advise).
*   **For Feature Requests / Enhancement Ideas:**
    *   The problem the feature would solve or the workflow it would improve.
    *   A clear description of the proposed feature.
    *   Potential benefits to our team or the broader CLI user base.
*   **For Internal Scripts/Automations to Propose (via `Kernel` primarily):**
    *   Description of the script/automation.
    *   The problem it solves internally.
    *   How it works (high-level).
    *   Potential for generalization as a `ContextVibes CLI` feature.

*(`Nexus` will refine these input guidelines further after the team meeting.)*

### 4.2 Internal Review & Escalation (Previously Section 4.1)
*   **Regular Review:** `Nexus` will regularly review submitted feedback with `Kernel` and other relevant technical personas to assess, reproduce (if a bug), and refine before escalating to the external team.
*   **Proactive Script/Automation Review:** `Kernel` will proactively share new internal scripts or automation patterns with `Nexus` that might be good candidates for generalization and inclusion in the official `ContextVibes CLI`.

*(Further details on specific communication channels, submission formats, and tracking tools will be added as this process matures.)*

## 5. Our Commitment

We are committed to being proactive and constructive partners with the `ContextVibes CLI` team, aiming for a mutually beneficial relationship that enhances the CLI's capabilities and our development efficiency.
