# Knowledge Base Index for THEA & AI-Assisted Development Framework

Version: 0.1.0

## Purpose

This document serves as the central, curated index to our organization's collected knowledge, key learnings, best practices, guides, and important reference materials related to THEA and the broader `ai-assisted-dev-framework`.

Its primary goal is to make valuable information easily discoverable and accessible to all team members.

## Updating This Index

As part of our **Lessons Learned & Knowledge Capture Process** (detailed in `docs/process/AGILE_FRAMEWORK_DEVELOPMENT.MD`), this Knowledge Base Index is a living document.

When new learning resources (e.g., guides, tooling examples, playbook updates, significant research findings) are created or updated based on captured lessons:

* `Canon` and `Scribe` are responsible for ensuring this index is updated with:
  * A clear **Subject/Title** of the resource.
  * Relevant **Keywords** for searchability.
  * A direct **Link** to the detailed document, playbook, or artifact.
  * A brief **Summary** of the resource's content or the learning it captures.
