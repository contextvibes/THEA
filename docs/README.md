# The Library: Project Documentation

Welcome to the `docs/` directory. This is the internal knowledge base for the THEA project itself.

## Purpose

The contents of this directory represent **The Library**. This documentation is *about the project*, not the distributable guidance. It's where we document our processes, decisions, and history.

**Key Distinction:**
*   `thea/` contains the **product** we ship.
*   `docs/` contains the **process** by which we build and manage the project.

## Directory Structure

*   ### `lessons_learned_sessions/`
    *   **Purpose:** A repository of notes and reflections from our internal review sessions. This is where we capture what went well and what could be improved.

*   ### `process/`
    *   **Purpose:** Formal documentation of our team's development processes, such as our agile framework definition.

*   ### `product_backlog/`
    *   **Purpose:** Detailed specifications for Product Backlog Items (PBIs). This is where we define and track upcoming work on the THEA framework itself.

*   ### `research_findings/`
    *   **Purpose:** An archive of research briefs and findings that *informed* the creation of THEA. This is distinct from the consumable research papers that are part of the product in `thea/foundations/research-papers/`.

## How to Contribute

When contributing to the project's internal documentation, please follow these guidelines:
1.  Use the existing templates for new PBIs or lessons learned sessions where applicable.
2.  Ensure that process documentation is reviewed and approved by the team before being merged.
3.  Keep the focus on the *project's lifecycle*, not the end-user guidance.
