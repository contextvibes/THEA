# Inbox

This directory serves as a temporary staging area for documents, proposals, notes, or other artifacts that are pending review, processing, or formal integration into the THEA framework.

## Purpose

*   To hold items that are not yet ready for a specific location within `docs/`, `playbooks/`, `research/`, or `thea/`.
*   To facilitate collaborative review of new proposals or drafts before they are finalized.
*   To temporarily store outputs from tools or external sources that need further analysis.

## Guidelines

*   **Do not commit raw working files or large datasets directly into this directory in the `main` branch.** This `README.md` and a `.gitkeep` file are the only files that should typically be version-controlled here.
*   Files placed here should be considered transient. Once processed, they should be:
    *   Moved to their appropriate permanent location within the repository.
    *   Converted into GitHub Issues or Product Backlog Items.
    *   Deleted if no longer needed.
*   Use descriptive filenames for items placed here during your work on a feature branch.
*   Refer to this `README.md` for any questions about the `inbox/`'s intended use.

*(This `README.md` is managed by Canon and Scribe.)*
