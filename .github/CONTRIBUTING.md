# How to Contribute to THEA

First off, thank you for considering contributing to THEA! We welcome any and all ideas that can help us improve our framework for AI-assisted development. This document provides a high-level overview of how you can contribute.

## Guiding Principles

- **Openness:** We welcome ideas and contributions from everyone.
- **Transparency:** We use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to track all changes and discussions.
- **Respect:** All interactions should follow our "Be Kind" principle.

## The Easiest Way to Contribute: Submit an Idea

The best way to propose an improvement, report a bug, or request a new feature is by **opening a GitHub Issue**.

[**Click here to open a new Issue**](https://github.com/your-repo/thea/issues/new/choose)

Simply choose the appropriate template, fill in the details, and our team will review it.

### What to Expect After Submitting an Issue:

1.  **Triage & Review:** Our project leads (`Orion` and `Athena`) will review your submission for strategic fit and value. They will label it accordingly.
2.  **Formalization:** If the idea is accepted, it will be converted into a formal Product Backlog Item (PBI) and added to our work queue.
3.  **Implementation:** The PBI will then be prioritized and worked on by the team as part of our regular development Sprints.

For a detailed breakdown of this entire process, please see our **[Contribution and Improvement Process Playbook](thea/application-guides/playbooks/process_guidance/contribution-and-improvement-playbook.md)**.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

If you wish to contribute code or documentation directly, we ask that you please follow these steps:

1.  Find a PBI in our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/thea/issues)** that is labeled `status: accepted` and `help-wanted`.
2.  Follow the instructions in the PBI to implement the required changes.
3.  Submit a Pull Request, linking it to the PBI issue you are addressing.

Thank you again for your interest in making THEA better!
