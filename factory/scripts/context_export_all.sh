# WHAT: Exports a comprehensive snapshot of the entire project, organized
#       by our "Product, Library, Factory" architectural model.
# WHY:  Provides a complete, structured context file for high-level AI
#       analysis, onboarding, or architectural review. This version is
#       "root-aware" and will function correctly even when run from a subdirectory.
