# Refinement Research Directive: From Best Practices to THEA Standards

### Objective
This is a follow-up directive. Based on the "Foundational Best Practices Brief" you previously provided, we now require deeper, more specific research to transform those general best practices into actionable, opinionated standards for the THEA framework. The goal is to address specific ambiguities and edge cases relevant to a professional team environment.

### Core Refinement Areas

**1. For `Sparky` (Environment Stability and Developer Experience):**

-   **Research Question 1.1 (Nixpkgs Channel Strategy):**
    -   The brief recommends a `stable` channel. What is the detailed trade-off for a professional team between using `stable` versus `unstable`? Investigate the typical lag time for security patches and minor version bumps of key tools (like Go, NodeJS) on a `stable` channel compared to `unstable`. What is the recommended THEA policy for balancing stability with access to modern features?

-   **Research Question 1.2 (Extension Versioning and Management):**
    -   The brief explains how to add extensions via `idx.extensions`. Can the versions of these VS Code extensions be pinned within `dev.nix`? If not, what is the standard mechanism for ensuring all developers are running the same version of a critical extension (e.g., the Go language server extension) to prevent "it works on my machine" issues caused by an extension update?

-   **Research Question 1.3 (Secrets Management in Lifecycle Hooks):**
    -   The brief covers `env` for non-sensitive data. What is the official, most secure method for a script in `idx.workspace.onCreate` or `onStart` to access **secrets** (e.g., a private `npm` token for `npm install`, or a database password for a schema migration script)? Is there a Firebase Studio-native secret store, or should we rely on environment variables injected in a more secure way?

-   **Research Question 1.4 (Resolving Tooling Conflicts):**
    -   What is the best practice for resolving potential conflicts where a VS Code extension might try to install or manage its own version of a tool (like `gopls` or `eslint`) that is already provided by the Nix environment? How do we ensure the Nix-provided version is always prioritized and used by the IDE?

**2. For `Kernel` (Automation and CI/CD Parity):**

-   **Research Question 2.1 (CI/CD Environment Parity):**
    -   The `dev.nix` file defines the local development environment. How can we achieve tooling parity in a CI/CD environment like GitHub Actions? Can a GitHub Actions runner directly use our `dev.nix` file to install the exact same tool versions for a build or test job? Provide a sample GitHub Actions workflow snippet that attempts this.

-   **Research Question 2.2 (Programmatic Validation of `dev.nix`):**
    -   The brief mentions formatters like `nixfmt`. Is there a standard tool to programmatically **lint or validate** a `dev.nix` file for common errors (e.g., referencing a non-existent package) *before* attempting a full environment rebuild? This would be critical for a pre-commit hook or a fast CI check.

**3. For Strategic Governance (`Orion` and `Canon`):**

-   **Research Question 3.1 (Policy on Local Overrides):**
    -   The brief mentions the pattern of using an `imports` statement with a git-ignored `dev.local.nix` file for user-specific overrides. This needs a formal policy. What should THEA's official stance be? What types of configurations are **permissible** in `dev.local.nix` (e.g., personal editor themes, non-essential tools) versus what is **forbidden** (e.g., changing the version of Go, overriding a project-critical environment variable)?

-   **Research Question 3.2 (Nixpkgs Channel Update Strategy):**
    -   The brief suggests updating the pinned `stable` channel periodically. We need to define this process. What is a recommended quarterly or semi-annual workflow for a team to safely evaluate and roll out a new `stable` channel version (e.g., moving from `stable-24.05` to `stable-24.11`)? What testing should be performed?

### Expected Output Format

Deliver the research as a structured Markdown document titled **"THEA `dev.nix` Standards: Refinement and Policy"**. Each research question above should be a main heading, with the findings presented as clear, concise answers and, where applicable, with code snippets or policy recommendations.
