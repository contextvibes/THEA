# Universal Research Directive for Specialized LLM

### Objective

Conduct a deep and practical investigation into the foundational best practices for creating and managing `.idx/dev.nix` files for projects within the Google Firebase Studio (formerly Project IDX) environment. The primary goal is to produce a "Foundational Best Practices Brief" that will serve as the core research for creating an official, universal team guide applicable to *all* THEA projects, regardless of the specific programming language or framework.

### Core Research Areas

1. **Nix Package Discovery and Canonical Naming (Universal Process):**
    - **Task:** Detail the authoritative, step-by-step process for a developer to find the correct "attribute name" for any package within the Nixpkgs repository.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - What is the primary, official website for searching Nix packages?
        - How should a developer interpret the search results to find the exact attribute name to use in `dev.nix`? Explain how to handle potential ambiguities (e.g., `pkgs.nodejs` vs. `pkgs.nodejs-18_x`).
        - Provide the canonical attribute names for a diverse set of common tools to serve as examples:
            - A command-line JSON processor (e.g., `jq`).
            - A modern version of the NodeJS runtime.
            - `markdownlint-cli` (the NodeJS-based Markdown linter).

2. **The Foundational `dev.nix` Template:**
    - **Task:** Research and present the most idiomatic, minimal, and well-structured `dev.nix` configuration that can serve as the starting template for any new THEA project.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - What are the essential, non-negotiable sections of a `dev.nix` file (`pkgs`, `env`, etc.)?
        - How should the file be structured and commented to make it clear where language-specific sections should be added later?
        - Provide a clean, copy-pasteable "base template" that includes only the absolute necessities and placeholders for future additions.

3. **Best Practices for Language-Specific Configuration (as a Pattern):**
    - **Task:** Using **Go** as a representative example, demonstrate the *pattern* for extending the foundational template for a specific language.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - What is the recommended set of packages for a productive Go environment?
        - How should these be documented within the `dev.nix` to distinguish them from universal tools?
        - Should language-specific environment variables (like `GOPATH`, if needed) be set, or does the Nix environment handle this automatically? This will establish the principle for other languages like Python's `PYTHONPATH`.

4. **Managing Environment Variables (Universal):**
    - **Task:** Define the correct syntax and provide clear examples for managing environment variables within the `env` block.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - How are simple string variables defined?
        - How can a developer reference other Nix variables or home directory paths (e.g., `$HOME`) within an environment variable's value?

5. **Firebase Studio Integration and Workflow (Universal):**
    - **Task:** Describe the end-to-end workflow for a developer modifying the `dev.nix` file.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - What action triggers the environment rebuild in Firebase Studio after `dev.nix` is saved?
        - Where should a developer look for logs if the environment rebuild fails?
        - How can a developer verify that a new package or environment variable has been successfully loaded into their workspace? Provide specific, universal commands for verification (`which <tool>`, `echo $VAR`).

6. **Style and Maintainability (Universal):**
    - **Task:** Research community-accepted best practices for keeping `dev.nix` files clean and maintainable.
    - **Key Questions to Answer:**
        - What are the recommendations for commenting and code organization?
        - Is there a standard for ordering packages (e.g., alphabetically)?

### Expected Output Format

The research should be delivered as a structured Markdown document titled **"Foundational Best Practices Brief: Universal `dev.nix` Management in Firebase Studio"**. The document should have the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary:** A brief overview of the key findings for establishing a universal standard.
2. **The Universal Workflow for Adding Packages:** A step-by-step guide to using the Nixpkgs search and a definitive list of the requested example package names.
3. **The THEA Foundational `dev.nix` Template:** A clean, commented base `dev.nix` file that serves as the starting point for all projects.
4. **Pattern for Language-Specific Extensions:** Using Go as a clear example, show how to add a language environment to the base template.
5. **Managing Environment Variables:** Clear examples and syntax guidance.
6. **The Developer Workflow:** A checklist for developers to follow when modifying any `dev.nix` file.
7. **Maintenance and Style Guide:** A list of actionable recommendations for keeping `dev.nix` files clean.
