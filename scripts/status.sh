#
# WHY: Generates a focused report on "what is new" for the current workspace.
# WHAT: It captures uncommitted local changes and, if on a feature branch,
#       the new commits and file diffs compared to the 'main' branch.
# HOW: Uses git commands to check status and diffs, then formats the
#      output into a structured markdown file for LLM context.
